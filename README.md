# Neuro
A simple neural network implementation from scratch in C++ (STL is used only). 
Clear OOP design, training algorithms were represented in the (well readable) matrix form.

**Methods:**
- base backpropagarion method was implemented.
- multitheading resilient back propagation (Rprop) was implemented.

**Train data sets file's formats:**
- simple handwriting digits (32x32) in the binary form (~950 samples).
- mnist digits handwriting digits (24x24) - 60000 samples.

**TODO**
- convolutional neural network
